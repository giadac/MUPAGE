MUPAGE : a MUon GEnerator from PArametric formulas. 
version 3 release 4

The MUPAGE code was developed for the production of atmospheric 
multimuons on the underwater detector CAN surface, without a
full Monte Carlo simulation but using parametric formulas.
MUPAGE is for ANTARES users.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES

src/mupage.cc : C++ code; all MUPAGE routines are there.

dat/parameters.dat : input file with some default parameters:
		     * the ANTARES detector CAN parameters and its 
		       depth (for default, parameters are taken from 
   		       the $THRONG_DIR/DETECTOR/d10_c00_s00.det file);
		     * the zenithal angle range; 
		     * parameters for multiplicity, radial 
		       distribution, energy spectra 
		       (see internal note ANTARES-Phys/2006-003);
		     * seawater density
		     * threshold energy
   		     WARNING: use the reported units!

HOW TO USE MUPAGE

* The code was tested on gcc version 3.2.x, 3.4.x and 4.1.x
* This version (v3r4) runs on Scientific Linux 4.x (32 bit)
* If you can not use ccali server, please contact me: a version also 
  for not ANTARES users exists.

*******************************************************************
*******************************************************************
HOW TO EXECUTE MUPAGE

* type "make"
* type "./run-MUPAGE.csh"

*****************************************************************************
*****************************************************************************
HOW TO MODIFY THE RANDOM SEED, THE DETECTOR PARAMETERS OR THE DEFAULT 
PARAMETERS TO COMPUTE PARAMETRIC FORMULAS

* In run-MUPAGE.csh it is possible to modify the random seed, the run number
  and the number of events to generate. It is also possible to choose in 
  which folder MUPAGE code must write the output files and select the 
  detector (by default, there is the most updated). Furthermore it is 
  possible write the output file in a formatted ASCII table adding the option
  '-t'.
* In dat/parameters.dat, it is possible to set other detector geometries 
  (with respective maximum sea depth) different from the defined ANTARES
  detectors. May be attention to comment out the option '-g GEOFIL' in
  run-MUPAGE.csh 
* In dat/parameters.dat, it is also possible to modify the minimum and the 
  maximum value of muon multiplicity, the minimum and the maximum value of 
  the radial distribution for multiple muons, the range of zenithal angle and
  the seawater density. It is also possible to generate events with a 
  threshold energy (larger than 1 GeV, that is the minimum generable energy). 
  Beside each parameter you find the description of it (see internal note 
  ANTARES-Phys/2006-003) and the units to use. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: Use the reported units!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: In file dat/parameters.dat the seawater density is reported. For 
    not using, set it up as 1.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: In file dat/parameters.dat the MULTmax default parameter is setted 
    up as 1000. If a smaller detector than ANTARES full detector is
    used, MULTmax can be fixed as 100. This doesn't cause a 
    physical information losing, but a lot of CPU time can be 
    saved. In this way, the running process can be faster also of a
    factor 4.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: The multiplicity inside the "track_bundle" can be different of the 
    number of "track_id", because one or more muons in bundle can't be 
    reached the CAN for geometrical acceptance.

ABOUT LIVETIME COMPUTATION

The method to compute the equivalent livetime of a run in seconds 
is described in the internal note ANTARES-Phys/2006-003.
The file livetime/livetime_run-01.info is an example of livetime 
computation. In this file there is information about the number
of generated events and how many of these events are arriving on 
the upper disk of the CAN. In the table, the user can find the 
values used to compute the equivalent livetime for every range of 
zenithal angles. N* is the number of single events generated on the 
upper disk of the CAN in that specific range of zenithal angles.
Delta N* is the statistical (poissonian) error of N*. N*_MC is the 
expected rate of single muon events at that given solid angle.
T is the equivalent livetime (T = N*/N*_MC) and Delta T is the 
statistical error (Delta T = Delta N*/N*_MC).
The average livetime is the weighted average of all livetimes in that 
table with the error computed as the square root of the variance.

The equivalent livetime of the run in seconds is reported in the 
header of output file. The livetime format is:
> livetime:  weighted_average   square_root_of_the_variance
E.g. "livetime: 8.06e+03    3" means that the duration of that
particular run is (8060 \pm 3) seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: The weight of each event is the same, so with the usual notation 
    the w3 weight is: w3=(1/livetime) sec**-1.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NB: In the header of output file, the tag "norma" is added. With 
    the usual data format, the second integer is the number of 
    events generated for that run.
